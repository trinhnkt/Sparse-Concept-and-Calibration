    "an area-under-the-curve (AUC) score, so population ranking can look "
    "acceptable while probabilities are poorly calibrated on rarely practiced "
    "knowledge components (KCs). We specify a train-only sparse-concept "
    "evaluation protocol that combines learner-based and temporal views, "
    "explicit cold-start definitions, occupancy-aware reporting, 15-bin "
    "expected calibration error (ECE), Brier score with the Murphy "
    "decomposition (uncertainty − resolution + reliability), reliability "
    "diagrams, and L1–L7 leakage control. The protocol is applied to three "
    "public logs (ASSISTments 2012, Junyi Academy, and XES3G5M) with IRT, "
    "DKT, and a local Transformer KT baseline (T-KT; not SimpleKT [4]); "
    "official SimpleKT is scored on ASSISTments AUC/ECE only. Lower KC "
    "training frequency does not universally degrade discrimination: Junyi’s "
    "exercise-level operational identifier (ucid) yields no learner-based "
    "sparse stratum, and XES3G5M T-KT ECE is essentially flat (0.1176, "
    "0.1129, 0.1254), whereas ASSISTments 2012 T-KT ECE rises from 0.114 on "
    "dense KCs to 0.228 on sparse KCs (Limited occupancy, N≈415). A frozen "
    "review artifact and a one-command rebuild of the diagnostic tables from "
    "frozen summaries accompany the protocol; a locked simulated gate at "
